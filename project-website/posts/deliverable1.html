                <p>I am currently a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Co-op, Computer Science Specialist student at UTSC.</p>
                <p>I am a huge proponent of open source and maintain an active profile on GitHub. In my spare time I've been
                  contributing bug fixes and features to the text editor Visual Studio Code and its extensions, as well as
                  cmus, the most popular music player for Unix-like operating systems.</p>
                <p>Currently as a personal project I am working with the MEAN stack with TubeTranscribe, a web app for musicians
                  to help them learn how to play their favorite songs efficiently.</p>
                <p>Previously I've worked at the Ontario Science Centre as an exhibit developer, where I worked with a team
                  to create an educational replica of the International Space Station's Canadarm in under 3 months.</p>
