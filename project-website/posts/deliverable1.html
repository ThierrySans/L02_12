              <p>What makes the AI behave this way? What did the developers use to create such realistic 3D models? What does
                the future hold for this medium?</p>
              <p>These types of question have been constantly popping up in the mind of Harry Jiang, ever since he was little,
                as he completed a dungeon, solved a puzzle, or even deciphered a cryptic message written in a language from
                a make-believe world.</p>
              <p>Currently, he is a 4th year student at the UTSC management program, with the intention of someday owning a
                small business.</p>
              <p>However, mesmerized by this childhood hobby, he entered the management IT stream, where he can get a sense
                of how this hobby he enjoys tremendously really functions.</p>
              <p>Having the knowledge of project management along with his recently sharpened programming skills, he hopes that
                his diverse knowledge would be a valuable asset to the team.</p>
              <p>His favorite pass time is no doubt, the main reason why he is writing this biography, “video games”.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>Our main objective is to complete the assignment given by Professor Sohee Kang. The team will attempt to deliver a brand
            new, fully functional and aesthetically appealing version of WeBWork, an open source online homework system for
            math and statistic students. We will make sure our software will at least perform all the fundamental functions
            and meet the required standards.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we hope to create a design that is intuitive for different types
            of students, whether or not they’re experienced with technology. Also, we hope this learning experience will
            be a chance to challenge ourselves to develop better coding, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skill.
            Ultimately, we wish to do our best to enrich the student’s overall learning experience.

          <p>From technicality to creativity, the members of Code Manglers have a wide range of ability and expertise. The team’s
            skill set varies from the statistics, project management, visual art, and even digital animation.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, the common ground which holds the team together, is the interest and knowledge in computer science.
            This includes the experience in programming language such as C, Java, Python, and also other technology related
            projects such as Android development, HTML, SQL database, robotics, and such.</p>
